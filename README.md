### Project for: Laboratorio di Programmazione di Sistemi Mobili 

## Idea
Creating a mobile app to explore, search and purchase your favourite movies quickly and easily.

## What the app can do 
- Explore and Search: Browse a vast collection of movies. Use the search function to easily find your favourite titles. (powered by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)).
- Secure Access: Create your account and log in in a few easy steps.
- Buy and Receive: Choose the movie you want, enter your home address, and complete your purchase securely. Your film(s) will be shipped and delivered within 5 business days!
- Share with Friends: Did you find a movie you like? Share it with your contacts directly from the app.

## Features and Future Improvements
- Wishlist: Allow users to create a wish list with movies they would like to purchase in the future
- Reviews and Ratings: Allow users to leave reviews and rate movies they have purchased
- Social Media Integration: Allow users to link their social accounts to share movies and reviews with their friends more easily
- News and Blog Section: Add a section with film news and articles, reviews, interviews with actors and directors
- User Feedback: Implements a system to collect direct feedback from users on the app. This can provide valuable information about what could be improved
